Username and password
=====================

- **Enabled**. If selected, the user can login using username and password.
- **Password**. Various settings for changing the password length and strength are found here.
- **Max login attempts**. Providing the wrong password more times than this number results in a locked user. A locked user can be unlocked by *resetting the user password*.  

    .. note:: 0 means infinite number of attempts.
- **Minimum password length**. Minimum password length is 1. 
- **Max days password valid**. The user needs to change his or her password after such many days. 

    .. note:: 0 means infinite number of days.
